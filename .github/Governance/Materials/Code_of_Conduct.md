#### Unwelcomed behavior
*Hard to define? Some questions to ask yourself are*:

* how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient?
* would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way?
* would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization’s newsletter?
* could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group?
* could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing?
* would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ?

*Summary: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don’t do it.*
