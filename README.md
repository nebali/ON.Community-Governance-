## Background

Building on the efforts of OmiseGO community member, Kartsims, who originated a Mission Statement for this community to begin self-organizing around our shared interests and goals for the OmiseGO Network ("OMG Network"), the following materials reflect a design for this  initiative to take definitive form as a *[Chaordic Commons](http://www.chaordic.org/)* to support the OMG Network into the future.

* ***[OMG NETWORK COMMUNITY PRINCIPLES](.github/Governance/Materials/Principles.md)***

* ***[ETHEREUM COMMUNITY CODE OF CONDUCT](.github/Governance/Materials/Code_of_Conduct.md)***
